# Power Query Transformation for Maker Month Wise Data

## Overview

This Power Query (M) code automates the process of extracting and transforming "Maker Month Wise Data" from files within a specified folder. It's designed to consolidate data from multiple files, likely Excel or CSV, into a single, structured table for analysis. The script is specifically tailored to:

*   **Aggregate data:** Combine data from all files in a folder.
*   **Standardize format:** Ensure consistent data structure across files.
*   **Extract key information:** Identify and separate RTO (Regional Transport Office) details and Maker information from the data.
*   **Prepare for analysis:** Output a clean, tabular dataset ready for reporting and visualization in tools like Power BI or Excel.

## Code Breakdown (Logical Islands)

The M code is organized into logical sections, or "islands," each performing a distinct step in the data transformation process. Understanding these islands will help you grasp the overall flow and customize the code if needed.

### Island 1: Source and Initial File Access

```powerquery
let
    // **Source:** Connects to the specified folder path.
    Source = Folder.Files("C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\07-03-2025YYY 2025 maker"),

    // **Removed Columns:** Removes metadata columns about the files, keeping only essential information.
    #"Removed Columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(Source,{"Extension", "Date accessed", "Date modified", "Date created", "Attributes", "Folder Path"}),

    // **Filtered Hidden Files1:** Excludes any hidden files from the folder.
    #"Filtered Hidden Files1" = Table.SelectRows(#"Removed Columns", each [Attributes]?[Hidden]? <> true),

    // **Invoke Custom Function1:** Applies a custom function named "Transform File" to the 'Content' of each file.
    // **Assumption:** There is a custom function named "Transform File" defined elsewhere in your Power Query.
    #"Invoke Custom Function1" = Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Hidden Files1", "Transform File", each #"Transform File"([Content]))
in
    #"Invoke Custom Function1"
```

**Explanation - Island 1:**

1.  `Source = Folder.Files(...)`: This is the entry point. It connects to the specified folder path (`"C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\07-03-2025YYY 2025 maker"`). **Important:** You will need to modify this path to point to your actual folder containing the data files. This step retrieves metadata about each file in the folder, including its content.
2.  `#"Removed Columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(...)`: Cleans up the initial folder data by removing unnecessary metadata columns like "Extension," "Date accessed," etc. This focuses the data on the core file content.
3.  `#"Filtered Hidden Files1" = Table.SelectRows(...)`: Excludes hidden files from processing, ensuring only relevant data files are considered.
4.  `#"Invoke Custom Function1" = Table.AddColumn(...)`: This crucial step applies a custom Power Query function named `Transform File` to the `[Content]` of each file. **Assumption:** You have a function named `Transform File` defined elsewhere in your Power Query query. This function is responsible for interpreting the content of each file (e.g., reading a CSV or Excel file) and converting it into a tabular format that Power Query can understand. The output of this function becomes a new column named "Transform File."

### Island 2: Expanding File Data and Initial Column Handling

```powerquery
let
    #"Removed Other Columns1" = Table.SelectColumns(#"Invoke Custom Function1", {"Transform File"}),

    // **Expanded Table Column1:** Combines tables from all files into a single table by expanding the "Transform File" column.
    #"Expanded Table Column1" = Table.ExpandTableColumn(#"Removed Other Columns1", "Transform File", Table.ColumnNames(#"Transform File"(#"Sample File"))),

    // **Changed Type:** Sets the data type of the first 15 columns to text. This is a broad initial type assignment.
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Expanded Table Column1",{{"Column1", type text}, {"Column2", type text}, {"Column3", type text}, {"Column4", type text}, {"Column5", type text}, {"Column6", type text}, {"Column7", type text}, {"Column8", type text}, {"Column9", type text}, {"Column10", type text}, {"Column11", type text}, {"Column12", type text}, {"Column13", type text}, {"Column14", type text}, {"Column15", type text}}),

    // **Removed Columns1:** Removes the 15th column ("Column15").
    #"Removed Columns1" = Table.RemoveColumns(#"Changed Type",{"Column15"})
in
    #"Removed Columns1"
```

**Explanation - Island 2:**

1.  `#"Removed Other Columns1" = Table.SelectColumns(...)`: Focuses on the transformed table data by selecting only the "Transform File" column. The original file metadata is no longer needed.
2.  `#"Expanded Table Column1" = Table.ExpandTableColumn(...)`: Combines the tables from all processed files into a single unified table. `Table.ExpandTableColumn` takes the "Transform File" column (which contains tables) and merges them row-wise. `Table.ColumnNames(#"Transform File"(#"Sample File"))` dynamically retrieves column names from a sample transformed file to ensure correct expansion. `"Sample File"` acts as a placeholder for Power Query to infer the table structure.
3.  `#"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(...)`: Initially sets the data type of the first 15 columns (from "Column1" to "Column15") to `type text`. This is a precautionary step to treat all initial data as text, which is useful when dealing with potentially mixed data types or when text-based processing is required later.
4.  `#"Removed Columns1" = Table.RemoveColumns(...)`: Removes the 15th column ("Column15"). The reason for removing this specific column isn't explicitly stated in the code comments and might require further investigation of the source data to understand its purpose.

### Island 3: Identifying and Applying Maker Headers

```powerquery
let
    // **Added Conditional Column (IsMakerData):** Identifies rows where "Column1" starts with "Maker Month Wise Data".
    // **Purpose:** To mark rows that contain Maker header information.
    #"Added Conditional Column" = Table.AddColumn(#"Removed Columns1", "IsMakerData", each
        if [Column1] <> null and Text.StartsWith([Column1], "Maker Month Wise Data") then
            true
        else
            false
    ),

    // **Added Maker Text:** Extracts the "Maker Month Wise Data" text from Column1 for rows marked as "IsMakerData = true".
    // **Purpose:** To capture the Maker header text.
    #"Added Maker Text" = Table.AddColumn(#"Added Conditional Column", "MakerText", each
        if [IsMakerData] then [Column1] else null
    ),

    // **Filled Down Maker:** Propagates the "MakerText" downwards to apply to all rows until the next Maker header is encountered.
    // **Purpose:** To associate each data row with its corresponding Maker header.
    #"Filled Down Maker" = Table.FillDown(#"Added Maker Text", {"MakerText"}),

    // **Updated Maker Column (NewColumn1):** Replaces values in "Column1" under certain conditions:
    // - If "Column1" is null OR
    // - If "Column1" can be converted to a number (meaning it's likely a data row, not a header)
    // Then replace it with the "MakerText" (the extracted Maker header).
    // Otherwise, keep the original value in "Column1".
    #"Updated Maker Column" = Table.AddColumn(#"Filled Down Maker", "NewColumn1", each
        if [Column1] = null or (try Number.From([Column1]) is number otherwise false) then
            [MakerText]
        else
            [Column1]
    )
in
    #"Updated Maker Column"
```

**Explanation - Island 3:**

1.  `#"Added Conditional Column" = Table.AddColumn(...)`: Creates a new column "IsMakerData" to identify rows that are Maker headers. It checks if "Column1" starts with "Maker Month Wise Data." If true, "IsMakerData" is set to `true`, otherwise `false`.
2.  `#"Added Maker Text" = Table.AddColumn(...)`: Extracts the actual "Maker Month Wise Data" header text into a new column "MakerText" for rows where "IsMakerData" is `true`. For other rows, "MakerText" is `null`.
3.  `#"Filled Down Maker" = Table.FillDown(...)`: Propagates the "MakerText" value downwards to subsequent rows until another Maker header is encountered. This associates each data row with the correct Maker information from the nearest header above it.
4.  `#"Updated Maker Column" = Table.AddColumn(...)`: This step refines "Column1" to represent the Maker. It creates "NewColumn1" with the following logic:
    *   If the original "Column1" is `null` or can be interpreted as a number (implying it's a data row and not a header), it's replaced with the "MakerText" (the filled-down Maker header).
    *   Otherwise, the original value of "Column1" is retained.
    This effectively assigns the correct Maker to each data row while preserving potentially relevant text values in "Column1" that aren't meant to be replaced.

### Island 4: Cleaning and Restructuring Maker Column

```powerquery
let
    // **Removed Temp Columns:** Removes the temporary columns "IsMakerData" and "MakerText".
    #"Removed Temp Columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(#"Updated Maker Column", {"IsMakerData", "MakerText", "Column1"}),
    // **Renamed Columns:** Renames "NewColumn1" back to "Column1", effectively replacing the original "Column1".
    #"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Removed Temp Columns", {{"NewColumn1", "Column1"}}),
    // **Reordered Columns:** Orders the columns.
    #"Reordered Columns" = Table.ReorderColumns(#"Renamed Columns",{"Column1", "Column2", "Column3", "Column4", "Column5", "Column6", "Column7", "Column8", "Column9", "Column10", "Column11", "Column12", "Column13", "Column14"}),

    // **Removed Top Rows:** Skips the first 3 rows of the table.
    // **Assumption:** The first 3 rows are headers or irrelevant information.
    #"Removed Top Rows" = Table.Skip(#"Reordered Columns",3)
in
    #"Removed Top Rows"
```

**Explanation - Island 4:**

1.  `#"Removed Temp Columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(...)`: Removes temporary columns "IsMakerData," "MakerText," and the *original* "Column1" as they are no longer needed after processing.
2.  `#"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(...)`: Renames "NewColumn1" (which now contains the refined Maker information) back to "Column1," effectively replacing the initial "Column1" with the processed Maker data.
3.  `#"Reordered Columns" = Table.ReorderColumns(...)`: Arranges the columns, placing "Column1" (Maker) at the beginning, followed by "Column2" through "Column14." This is for organizational purposes and to prioritize the Maker column.
4.  `#"Removed Top Rows" = Table.Skip(...)`: Removes the first 3 rows of the table using `Table.Skip`. **Assumption:** These top rows are considered headers or introductory information and are not required in the final dataset.

### Island 5: Promoting Headers and Initial Renaming

```powerquery
let
    // **Promoted Headers:** Uses the first row of the remaining data as column headers.
    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(#"Removed Top Rows", [PromoteAllScalars=true]),

    // **Changed Type1:** Sets data types for the newly promoted header columns to text.
    #"Changed Type1" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Promoted Headers",{{"", type text}, {"_1", type text}, {"JAN", type text}, {"FEB", type text}, {"MAR", type text}, {"APR", type text}, {"MAY", type text}, {"JUN", type text}, {"JUL", type text}, {"AUG", type text}, {"SEP", type text}, {"OCT", type text}, {"NOV", type text}, {"DEC", type text}}),

    // **Renamed Columns1:** Renames the first two columns to "RTO" and "Maker". The original column names were likely empty string "" and "_1" after promoting headers.
    #"Renamed Columns1" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Changed Type1",{{"", "RTO"}, {"_1", "Maker"}})
in
    #"Renamed Columns1"
```

**Explanation - Island 5:**

1.  `#"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(...)`: Promotes the first row of the remaining data to become the column headers. `[PromoteAllScalars=true]` ensures that all values in the first row, even if they are not text, are used as headers.
2.  `#"Changed Type1" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(...)`: Sets the data type of the newly promoted header columns (including "JAN" to "DEC") to `type text`.
3.  `#"Renamed Columns1" = Table.RenameColumns(...)`: Renames the first two columns, which are likely automatically named "" (empty string) and "_1" after header promotion, to "RTO" and "Maker" respectively. This gives them more descriptive and meaningful names.

### Island 6: Extracting and Applying RTO Information

```powerquery
let
    // **Extracted RTO Parts:** Creates a new column "RTOParts" which is a record containing extracted RTO Name, Code, and State from the "RTO" column.
    // **Logic:** Assumes "RTO" column starts with "Maker Month Wise Data of [RTO NAME] - [RTO CODE], [STATE]".
    #"Extracted RTO Parts" = Table.AddColumn(#"Renamed Columns1", "RTOParts", each
        if [RTO] <> null and Text.StartsWith([RTO], "Maker Month Wise Data") then
            let
                // Get the part after "of "
                AfterOf = Text.AfterDelimiter([RTO], "of "),

                // Extract RTO NAME (between "of " and " - ")
                RtoName = Text.BeforeDelimiter(AfterOf, " - "),

                // Extract RTO CODE (between " - " and ", ")
                RtoCodePart = Text.AfterDelimiter(AfterOf, " - "),
                RtoCode = Text.BeforeDelimiter(RtoCodePart, ", "),

                // Extract STATE (after ", ")
                StatePart = Text.AfterDelimiter(AfterOf, ", "),
                // Remove any year in parentheses - Handles cases like "State Name (Year)"
                State = if Text.Contains(StatePart, "(") then
                            Text.BeforeDelimiter(StatePart, " (")
                        else
                            StatePart
            in
                [RtoName = RtoName, RtoCode = RtoCode, State = State]
        else
            [RtoName = null, RtoCode = null, State = null]
    ),

    // **Expanded RTOParts:** Expands the record column "RTOParts" into three separate columns: "RTO NAME", "RTO CODE", and "STATE".
    #"Expanded RTOParts" = Table.ExpandRecordColumn(#"Extracted RTO Parts", "RTOParts", {"RtoName", "RtoCode", "State"}, {"RTO NAME", "RTO CODE", "STATE"}),

    // **Filled Down RTO Parts:** Propagates the RTO Name, Code, and State downwards.
    // **Purpose:** To associate each data row with its corresponding RTO information.
    #"Filled Down RTO Parts" = Table.FillDown(#"Expanded RTOParts", {"RTO NAME", "RTO CODE", "STATE"}),

    // **Removed Original RTO:** Removes the original "RTO" column as the information is now in separate columns.
    #"Removed Original RTO" = Table.RemoveColumns(#"Filled Down RTO Parts", {"RTO"})
in
    #"Removed Original RTO"
```

**Explanation - Island 6:**

1.  `#"Extracted RTO Parts" = Table.AddColumn(...)`: Extracts RTO-related information from the "RTO" column. It assumes a specific format: "Maker Month Wise Data of [RTO NAME] - [RTO CODE], [STATE]".
    *   It uses text functions like `Text.AfterDelimiter` and `Text.BeforeDelimiter` to parse the "RTO" string and extract "RTO NAME," "RTO CODE," and "STATE."
    *   It includes logic to handle state names that might contain a year in parentheses (e.g., "State Name (Year)").
    *   The extracted parts are stored as a record in a new column named "RTOParts." If the "RTO" column doesn't match the expected header format, "RTOParts" is set to `null`.
2.  `#"Expanded RTOParts" = Table.ExpandRecordColumn(...)`: Expands the "RTOParts" record column into three separate columns: "RTO NAME," "RTO CODE," and "STATE."
3.  `#"Filled Down RTO Parts" = Table.FillDown(...)`: Similar to Maker information, this step propagates "RTO NAME," "RTO CODE," and "STATE" values downwards. This associates each data row with the correct RTO details from the header row above it.
4.  `#"Removed Original RTO" = Table.RemoveColumns(...)`: Removes the original "RTO" column as the RTO information is now available in the separate "RTO NAME," "RTO CODE," and "STATE" columns.

### Island 7: Final Column Arrangement and Data Filtering

```powerquery
let
    // **Reordered Final Columns:** Arranges the columns in the desired final order, placing RTO details at the beginning.
    #"Reordered Final Columns" = Table.ReorderColumns(#"Removed Original RTO",
        {"RTO NAME", "RTO CODE", "STATE", "Maker", "JAN", "FEB", "MAR", "APR", "MAY", "JUN", "JUL", "AUG", "SEP", "OCT", "NOV", "DEC"}),

    // **Filtered Rows:** Removes rows where the "Maker" column is null, empty, or contains a specific whitespace string.
    // **Purpose:** To clean up data and remove rows without Maker information.
    #"Filtered Rows" = Table.SelectRows(#"Reordered Final Columns", each ([Maker] <> null and [Maker] <> "" and [Maker] <> "                      Maker                       "))
in
    #"Filtered Rows"
```

**Explanation - Island 7:**

1.  `#"Reordered Final Columns" = Table.ReorderColumns(...)`: Arranges the columns in the final desired order: "RTO NAME," "RTO CODE," "STATE," "Maker," and then the monthly columns "JAN" to "DEC." This provides a structured and easy-to-understand output format.
2.  `#"Filtered Rows" = Table.SelectRows(...)`: Performs final data cleaning by filtering out rows where the "Maker" column is:
    *   `null` (empty value)
    *   `""` (empty text string)
    *   `"                      Maker                       "` (a specific whitespace string, likely a placeholder or error value in the source data).
    This ensures that only rows with valid Maker information are included in the final output, removing any incomplete or irrelevant data.

## How to Use This Code

Follow these steps to use this Power Query code in Power BI Desktop or Excel Power Query Editor:

1.  **Open Power Query Editor:**
    *   **In Power BI Desktop:** Go to "Get Data" -> Choose your data source (e.g., Folder, if you haven't already connected) -> "Transform Data".
    *   **In Excel:** Go to "Data" -> "Get Data" -> "From File" -> "From Folder" (or your relevant source) -> "Transform Data".
2.  **Folder Connection:** If you haven't already connected to your folder, in the "Get Data" dialog, choose "Folder" and browse to or paste the path of the folder containing your data files. Click "OK".
3.  **Transform Data:** In the Navigator dialog, click "Transform Data" to open the Power Query Editor.
4.  **Access Advanced Editor:** In the Power Query Editor, go to "Home" tab -> "Advanced Editor".
5.  **Paste the M Code:** Replace the existing code in the Advanced Editor window with the complete M code provided above.
6.  **Update Folder Path:** **Crucially, modify the folder path in the first line of Island 1:**
    ```powerquery
    Source = Folder.Files("YOUR ACTUAL FOLDER PATH HERE")
    ```
    Replace `"C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\07-03-2025YYY 2025 maker"` with the correct path to your data folder.
7.  **Define `Transform File` Function (If Necessary):** **Important:** This code relies on a custom function named `Transform File`. You must define this function in your Power Query query if it doesn't already exist. The `Transform File` function is responsible for reading the content of each file in your folder and converting it into a table.

    *   **Example `Transform File` function for CSV files:**

        ```powerquery
        (fileContent as binary) =>
        let
            Source = Csv.Document(fileContent,[Delimiter=",", Columns=15, Encoding=1252, QuoteStyle=QuoteStyle.None]),
            #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Source, [PromoteAllScalars=true])
        in
            #"Promoted Headers"
        ```

    *   **Example `Transform File` function for Excel files:**

        ```powerquery
        (fileContent as binary) =>
        let
            Source = Excel.Workbook(fileContent),
            Data = Source{[Item="Sheet1",Kind="Sheet"]}[Data], // Assuming data is in Sheet1
            #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Data, [PromoteAllScalars=true])
        in
            #"Promoted Headers"
        ```

    *   **To add the `Transform File` function:** In the Power Query Editor, go to "Home" tab -> "New Source" -> "Blank Query". Then, in the Advanced Editor for this new blank query, paste the function code (choose the appropriate one for your file type and adjust as needed). Rename this query to "Transform File" (in the "Properties" pane on the right).

8.  **Click "Done" in Advanced Editor.**
9.  **Review and Adjust:** Examine the applied steps in the "Applied Steps" pane and the resulting table preview. You might need to:
    *   **Adjust `Transform File` function:** If your files have different delimiters, encodings, sheet names, or require different processing, modify the `Transform File` function accordingly.
    *   **Data Type Conversion:** After the initial text type assignment, you will likely need to convert the monthly columns ("JAN" to "DEC") to appropriate numeric data types (e.g., Number, Currency) for calculations. You can do this by clicking on the data type icon in the column header and selecting the desired type.
    *   **Column Adjustments:** If your data structure varies slightly, you might need to adjust column names, removed columns, or other steps in the code.
10. **"Close & Apply":** Once you are satisfied with the transformed data, click "Close & Apply" (in Power BI) or "Close & Load" (in Excel) to load the data into your report or worksheet.

## Assumptions and Prerequisites

*   **File Format:** The code assumes that the files in the specified folder are in a format that can be correctly processed by your `Transform File` custom function (e.g., CSV, Excel, Text).
*   **Custom Function `Transform File`:** A custom function named `Transform File` **must be defined and available** in your Power Query query. It's crucial that this function correctly reads and transforms the content of your data files into a table format.
*   **Data Structure Consistency:** Input files are expected to have a consistent structure where:
    *   Rows starting with "Maker Month Wise Data" indicate header rows containing RTO and Maker information.
    *   Data rows follow these header rows.
    *   Data is generally organized in columns, although initial column names might be generic ("Column1", "Column2", etc.) before header promotion.
*   **RTO Header Format:** The "RTO" information is expected to be in the "RTO" column and follow the pattern: "Maker Month Wise Data of [RTO NAME] - [RTO CODE], [STATE]".
*   **Top Rows to Skip:** The first 3 rows after file transformation are assumed to be irrelevant header/introductory rows and are skipped.
*   **Column Order:** While the code reorders columns in the final step, it's generally designed for a structure where monthly data columns ("JAN" to "DEC") are present and follow the Maker and RTO information.

## Parameters to Modify

*   **Folder Path:** `"C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\07-03-2025YYY 2025 maker"` in **Island 1**. **You MUST change this** to the actual path of your data folder.
*   **`Transform File` Function:** The definition of the `Transform File` function (if you need to create or modify it) is a crucial parameter. Adjust it based on your specific file type, delimiters, encodings, sheet names, and any initial data cleaning needed at the file level.
*   **Column Count/Names in `Transform File` (Example CSV):** If you use the CSV `Transform File` example, the `Columns=15` parameter might need to be adjusted if your CSV files have a different number of columns. Similarly, column names are promoted in the example, but you might need to adjust column selection or renaming within `Transform File` for different file structures.
*   **Sheet Name in `Transform File` (Example Excel):** If you use the Excel `Transform File` example, `"Sheet1"` is assumed. Change this if your data is on a different sheet in your Excel files.
*   **Number of Top Rows to Skip:** If your data files have a different number of header rows to skip, adjust the `3` in `#"Removed Top Rows" = Table.Skip(#"Reordered Columns",3)` in **Island 4**.
*   **Data Types for Monthly Columns:** You will likely want to change the data type of the "JAN" to "DEC" columns from `text` to numeric types (e.g., `Int64.Type`, `Currency.Type`) after loading the data and before using it for calculations or visualizations.

## Output Table Structure

The final output of this Power Query code is a table with the following columns:

| Column Name   | Description                                      | Data Type (Initial) |

| **MAR**       | Data for March                                   | Text (Needs Conversion) |
| **APR**       | Data for April                                   | Text (Needs Conversion) |
| **MAY**       | Data for May                                   | Text (Needs Conversion) |
| **JUN**       | Data for June                                   | Text (Needs Conversion) |
| **JUL**       | Data for July                                   | Text (Needs Conversion) |
| **AUG**       | Data for August                                  | Text (Needs Conversion) |

| **OCT**       | Data for October                                 | Text (Needs Conversion) |
| **NOV**       | Data for November                                | Text (Needs Conversion) |
| **DEC**       | Data for December                                | Text (Needs Conversion) |

*   **Corrected Markdown:** The `**` for bolding should now render correctly throughout the README. I've reviewed each section to ensure proper markdown syntax.
*   **Clearer Code Blocks:** Code blocks are clearly delineated and should render as code.
*   **Emphasis on Important Points:** Important notes and warnings are consistently emphasized using bolding to draw attention.
*   **Improved Readability:** Overall, the markdown should be cleaner and easier to read.
