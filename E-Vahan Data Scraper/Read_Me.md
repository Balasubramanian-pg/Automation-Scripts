# Vahan Scraper Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Python code for the `VahanScraper` class, designed to scrape data from the Vahan portal. This documentation is intended for beginners and aims to explain each part of the code in a structured and informative way.

## Overview

The `VahanScraper` class automates the process of extracting data from the Vahan portal, a website for vehicle registration in India. It uses Selenium WebDriver to control a Chrome browser and navigate the website. The scraper is designed to:

*   **Dynamically detect UI element IDs:**  The website uses dynamic IDs (like `j_idtXXX`), which can change. The scraper automatically detects these IDs to ensure robustness.
*   **Process data for all states and RTOs:** It iterates through all states and Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) available on the portal.
*   **Download data in Excel format:** It exports data as Excel files and organizes them into folders by date and state.
*   **Resume scraping:** It saves progress and can resume from where it left off if stopped.
*   **Handle errors and retries:** It includes error handling and retry mechanisms to make the scraping process more reliable.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into a single Python file (`vahan_scraper.py`) and contains the `VahanScraper` class along with a `main()` function to run the scraper.

### Imports

The script starts with importing necessary Python libraries:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains
from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException, NoSuchElementException
from datetime import datetime
import logging
import time
import json
import os
import re
import sys
```

These libraries are used for:

*   `selenium`: Web browser automation.
*   `datetime`: Working with dates and times.
*   `logging`:  Logging events and errors.
*   `time`:  Adding delays and managing time.
*   `json`:  Working with JSON data for saving progress.
*   `os`:  Operating system related functions (like file path manipulation).
*   `re`:  Regular expressions for text pattern matching.
*   `sys`:  System-specific parameters and functions.

### Logging Configuration

The script configures logging to both a file (`vahan_scraper.log`) and the console:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('vahan_scraper.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

This setup ensures that all informational messages, warnings, and errors are recorded for debugging and monitoring.

## `VahanScraper` Class

This class encapsulates all the scraping logic.

### `__init__(self, chrome_binary_path, download_path=None)`

```python
def __init__(self, chrome_binary_path, download_path=None):
    """
    Initializes the VahanScraper object.

    ... (rest of the docstring from the original code) ...
    """
    # ... (code from the original code) ...
```

**Purpose:** Initializes the `VahanScraper` object. This is the first function that runs when you create an instance of the `VahanScraper` class. It sets up the basic requirements for the scraper to function.

**Parameters:**

*   `chrome_binary_path` (str): Path to Chrome executable.
*   `download_path` (str, optional): Base path for downloads. Defaults to `F:/Flipcarbon/Ajax`.

**Functionality:**

1.  Stores Chrome Binary Path.
2.  Initializes WebDriver and Actions (set to `None` initially).
3.  Dynamic `j_idt` Labels (initialized as `None`).
4.  Sets Base Download Path.
5.  Creates Date Folder (based on current date).
6.  Progress Tracking (loads progress from `vahan_scraping_progress.json` or initializes new progress).

**Example:**

```python
scraper = VahanScraper(chrome_binary_path="C:/path/to/chrome.exe", download_path="D:/ScrapedData")
```

### `load_progress(self)`

```python
def load_progress(self):
    """
    Loads scraping progress from a JSON file.

    ... (rest of the docstring from the original code) ...
    """
    # ... (code from the original code) ...
```

**Purpose:** Loads scraping progress from `vahan_scraping_progress.json`. This is crucial for resuming the scraping process if it was stopped earlier.

**Functionality:**

1.  Checks for Progress File (`vahan_scraping_progress.json`).
2.  Loads Progress from File (if exists):
    *   Reads JSON data.
    *   Updates `self.current_state_index`, `self.current_rto_index`.
3.  Initializes New Progress (if file doesn't exist or on error).
4.  Error Handling (using `try-except`).

**Progress File Structure (`vahan_scraping_progress.json`):**

```json
{
    "current_state_index": 10,
    "current_rto_index": 2,
    "completed_states": {
        "Gujarat(37)": true,
        "Haryana(98)": true
    },
    "j_idt_labels": {
        "state_dropdown_j_idt": "j_idt123",
        "refresh_button_j_idt": "j_idt456",

## `main()` Function

```python
def main():
    """
    Main function to run the Vahan scraper.

    ... (rest of the docstring from the original code) ...
    """
    # ... (code from the original code) ...
```

**Purpose:** Entry point of the script, sets up Chrome path and runs the scraper.

**Functionality:**

1.  Chrome Binary Path Configuration (`chrome_path`).
    *   Path is set to `r"C:/Program Files (x86)/chrome-win64/chrome.exe"` (may need to be adjusted).
    *   Checks if Chrome binary exists (`os.path.exists(chrome_path)`).
    *   Raises `FileNotFoundError` if Chrome is not found.
2.  Scraper Instantiation and Execution (`scraper = VahanScraper(chrome_path)`, `scraper.scrape_data()`).
3.  Fatal Error Handling (outer `try-except` in `main` for critical errors).

**Purpose:**  Starts the scraping process and handles initial setup and fatal errors.

## Automation Flow

1.  **Script Execution:** `main()` function is called when the script starts.
2.  **Chrome Path Setup:** `main()` configures and verifies the Chrome browser path.
3.  **Scraper Initialization:** `VahanScraper` object is created in `main()`, initializing settings.
4.  **WebDriver Setup:** `scrape_data()` calls `setup_driver()` to launch Chrome and set up Selenium WebDriver.
5.  **`j_idt` Label Detection:** `scrape_data()` calls `detect_j_idt_labels()` to dynamically find UI element IDs.
6.  **State Processing Loop:** `scrape_data()` iterates through the `states_ut` list.
    *   **Navigation & Filters:** For each state, it navigates to the Vahan dashboard and initializes filters using `initialize_filters()`.
    *   **RTO Loop:** `process_state()` is called, which iterates through RTOs of the state.
        *   **Data Download:** For each RTO, it selects the RTO, refreshes data, and downloads the Excel file.
        *   **File Organization:** `move_file_to_state_folder()` moves and renames the downloaded file.
        *   **Progress Saving:** `save_progress()` saves progress after each RTO.
    *   **Error Handling & Retries:** Errors are handled at state and RTO levels with retry mechanisms.
7.  **Completion & Browser Closure:** After processing all states (or encountering fatal errors), the script closes the browser using `driver.quit()` and logs completion messages.

This structured documentation should provide a comprehensive understanding of the Vahan scraper code for users of all levels. Remember to adjust the `chrome_path` in the `main()` function if necessary and ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install selenium`).
