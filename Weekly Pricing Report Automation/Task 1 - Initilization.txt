If you're looking to automate weekly pricing updates using VBA, here's a basic outline of the process:

### **Steps for Weekly Pricing Automation (VBA)**
1. **Initialize the script** – Define file paths, sheets, and variables.
2. **Import Pricing Data** – Load new pricing data from an external source (CSV, Excel, database).
3. **Process & Update Pricing** – Apply calculations, lookup reference values, and validate updates.
4. **Save & Export** – Save changes and generate a report if needed.
5. **Schedule Execution** – Set up a Windows Task Scheduler or a VBA trigger to run this weekly.

### **VBA Code for Initialization (Task 1)**
```vba
Sub InitializePricingAutomation()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    
    ' Set the worksheet where pricing data is stored
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Pricing Data")

    ' Find the last row of data
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Clear previous data (optional)
    ws.Range("A2:Z" & lastRow).ClearContents
    
    ' Define necessary variables
    Dim sourceFilePath As String
    sourceFilePath = "C:\Path\To\WeeklyPricing.xlsx" ' Update with the correct path
    
    ' Notify user that initialization is complete
    MsgBox "Pricing automation initialized. Ready to import data.", vbInformation, "Initialization Complete"

End Sub
```
