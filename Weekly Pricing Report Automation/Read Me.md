# Automated Weekly Pricing Report with VBA
---

## üìù Use Case

The project has 3 phases, connecting excel workbook directly to a data source of your choice (ERP in my case), Extracting and cleaning a routine set of information from a designated master
and then creating a neat formatted report and mailing the same to the essential stakeholders.

## üöÄ Solution

A VBA-powered workflow was implemented to automate the entire process, which:

1. Pulled data from **DataSelect** queries for account and pricing information.
2. Created customized Excel workbooks from a predefined template.
3. Sent reports via email to authorized recipients based on strict access controls.
4. Minimized manual effort, reducing the task from hours to under 5 minutes.

### Process Flow

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Connected to the DataSelect system.
   - Fetched account and pricing data via queries.

2. **Workbook Creation**:
   - Generated a new workbook using a pre-configured Excel template.
   - Populated the workbook with account-specific data and price details.

3. **Report Distribution**:
   - Group reports sent to central teams (Finance, Credit Control).
   - Customized individual reports created and emailed to account managers.

4. **Notification**:
   - Confirmed completion of the task.

### Code Snippet

```vba
Sub GeneratePricingReports()
    ' Connect to DataSelect
    ConnectToDataSelect
    
    ' Create a new workbook from the template
    Set wb = Workbooks.Add(TemplatePath)
    wb.Name = "PricingReport_" & Format(Date, "YYYYMMDD")
    
    ' Loop through price lists
    For Each PriceList In PriceLists
        Call GeneratePriceList(wb, PriceList)
    Next PriceList
    
    ' Save the workbook
    wb.SaveAs FilePath & wb.Name
    DisconnectFromDataSelect
    
    ' Distribute Reports
    Call DistributeReports(wb)
    
    MsgBox "Pricing reports generated and sent successfully!", vbInformation
End Sub
