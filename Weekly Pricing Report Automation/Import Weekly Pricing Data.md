    Dim ws As Worksheet, srcWb As Workbook, srcWs As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long, srcFilePath As String
    Dim dataRange As Range, destRange As Range
    
    ' Set destination worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Pricing Data")
    
    ' Define the source file path (update path accordingly)
    srcFilePath = "C:\Path\To\WeeklyPricing.xlsx" ' Change to actual file path
    
    ' Check if the file exists
    If Dir(srcFilePath) = "" Then
        MsgBox "Source file not found!", vbExclamation, "File Error"
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    ' Open the source workbook
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    Application.DisplayAlerts = False
    Set srcWb = Workbooks.Open(srcFilePath)
    
    ' Set source worksheet (assuming first sheet)
    Set srcWs = srcWb.Sheets(1)
    
    ' Find last row in source file
    lastRow = srcWs.Cells(srcWs.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Define data range to copy
    Set dataRange = srcWs.Range("A2:Z" & lastRow) ' Adjust columns as needed
    
    ' Define destination range
    Set destRange = ws.Range("A2")
    
    ' Clear previous data
    ws.Range("A2:Z" & ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row).ClearContents
    
    ' Copy & paste values only
    dataRange.Copy
    destRange.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues
    
    ' Close source file
    srcWb.Close SaveChanges:=False
    
    ' Turn on screen updating
