# Understanding the Requirements:

    Input Data: You have 1570 Excel files, each containing vehicle sales data.

    >Tip File Structure:

        Title Row (Row 1): Contains information about RTO Name, RTO Code, and State. The format is consistent: "Vehicle Class Month Wise Data of [RTO Name] - [RTO Code] , [State Name] (2025)".

        Header Rows (Rows 1-3): Define the column structure. Specifically, Row 3 contains the month names.

        Data Rows (Starting from Row 4): Contain the actual sales data for each "Vehicle Class" for each month.

        Columns: "S No", "Vehicle Class", Month columns (like "JAN", "FEB", potentially more in the future), and "TOTAL".

    Output Data: You need to consolidate data from all Excel files into a single structured format, ideally a Pandas DataFrame, with the following columns:

        Vehicle Class

        State

        RTO Name

        RTO Code

        Month columns (dynamically captured, e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)

Key Challenges and Dynamic Aspects:

    Dynamic Months: The number of months in the Excel files is not fixed. Your code needs to automatically detect and include all months present in the header row.

    Dynamic RTO Information: RTO Name and RTO Code are embedded in the title and are different for each file. You need to extract these programmatically.

    State Name Extraction: Similarly, the State name is in the title and needs to be extracted.

    Handling 1570 Files: The solution needs to be efficient enough to process a large number of files.

    Data Structure Transformation: The input Excel structure needs to be transformed into a flat table format suitable for analysis.

Brainstorming the Approach:

    Iterate through files: We'll need to loop through all 1570 Excel files. Python's os module or glob module can be used to get a list of all files in a directory.

    Read each Excel file: For each file, we will use the pandas library to read the Excel file. We'll need to read it without headers initially to access the title row, and then read the data part with correct headers.

    Extract Metadata (RTO Name, RTO Code, State):

        Read the first row (index 0) of the Excel file. This is the title row.

        Use string manipulation or regular expressions to parse the title row and extract:

            RTO Name: Text between "Vehicle Class Month Wise Data of " and " RTO -".

            RTO Code: Text between " RTO -" and " ,".

            State Name: Text between " , " and " (".

    Extract Month Names:

        Read the third row (index 2) of the Excel file. This row contains the month names.

        Identify the columns that represent months. These are likely to be in the 'Month Wise' section of the header. We can look for column headers that resemble month abbreviations (JAN, FEB, MAR, etc.).

    Read Data and Transform:

        Read the data from the Excel file, starting from the 4th row (index 3) as the header row.

        Select the "Vehicle Class" column and the identified month columns.

        For each row of data, create a new row in our desired output format, adding the extracted RTO Name, RTO Code, and State to each row.

    Combine Data: As we process each Excel file, we will create a Pandas DataFrame for that file. We will then append/concatenate these DataFrames together to get a single consolidated DataFrame.

    Dynamic Month Columns: When creating the final DataFrame, we will use the extracted month names as column names. This ensures that if new months are added in the future, the code will automatically handle them.

    Data Cleaning (Optional but Recommended): After combining the data, we might want to perform some data cleaning steps, such as:

        Ensuring month columns are numeric.

        Handling any potential missing values (though based on the example, there don't seem to be many).

## Let's outline the steps in a more structured, algorithmic way:
---
      
Function process_excel_file(file_path):
    1. Read the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame (let's call it `df_raw`) without headers initially.
    2. Extract Title Row: `title_row = df_raw.iloc[0, 0]`
    3. Extract RTO Name, RTO Code, State from `title_row` using string operations (splitting/regex).
    4. Extract Month Row: `month_row = df_raw.iloc[2]`
    5. Identify Month Columns: Get month names from `month_row`. Filter out non-month related headers like "Month Wise", "TOTAL", "S No", "Vehicle Class", etc.
    6. Read Data with Headers: Read the Excel file again, this time starting data from row 4 as header (row index 3). Let's call this `df_data`.
    7. Select Relevant Columns: From `df_data`, select "Vehicle Class" column and the identified month columns.
    8. Create Output DataFrame:
        - Initialize an empty list `output_rows`.
        - For each row in the selected data from `df_data`:
            - Create a dictionary representing a row with keys: "Vehicle Class", "State", "RTO Name", "RTO Code", and the month names.
            - Populate the dictionary with data from the current row and the extracted metadata.
            - Append this dictionary to `output_rows`.
        - Convert `output_rows` list of dictionaries to a Pandas DataFrame.
    9. Return the created DataFrame.

### Main Script:
    1. Get a list of all Excel file paths in your directory.
    2. Initialize an empty list `all_dataframes`.
    3. For each `file_path` in the list:
        - Call `process_excel_file(file_path)` to get a DataFrame for that file.
        - Append the returned DataFrame to `all_dataframes`.
    4. Concatenate all DataFrames in `all_dataframes` into a single DataFrame `final_df`.
    5. (Optional) Save `final_df` to a CSV or Excel file.
    6. Print or further process `final_df`.

    



This plan seems comprehensive and addresses all the requirements, including dynamic month handling and metadata extraction. We will use Pandas for data manipulation and potentially the re module for more robust title parsing if needed. Let's proceed with writing the Python code based on this plan.
